gAnttlr Stories:

1. I want to create a Gantt chart so that I can schedule a project made up of task
	a) the Gantt model needs to have a create method
	b) the Gantt model needs to have tasks
	b 1) Tasks need a start and end time
	b 2) Tasks need a name and description
	b 3) Tasks need to know about their dependencies (i.e. what they depend on)
2. I want to view my friends Gantt charts so that I can see what they are doing

3. I want to combine Gantt charts so that I can see how my schedule is effected. (e.g. by train times).

4. I want to use gAnttlr to help estimate tasks (length etc).

5. I want to use gAnttlr to bake a cake.
